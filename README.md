# Yarn docu

A repo to store documentation around the twt.social rebranding/docu rewrite, to yarn.social. Based on the current documentation in the forked repos twtxt and jointwt.org.

If you'd like to contribute, I'm keeping a glorified To Do list in a GitHub project, for the moment.

Note that, in general, I'm using **bold** in the markdown as a placeholder for new links and locations that don't necessarily exist or may move.
