# Contributing

Welcome! We're in need of contributions, and very glad you're here. Whatever your level of experience, we can use your help. Quickly, you could:

- Submit a bug;
- Fix some code;
- Code a new feature;
- Fix our documentation;
- Manage pre-built binaries;
- Use this project!
- Spread the word; or
- Donate!

Just to name a few ideas; if you have others, feel free to reach out on one of our pods, or in our IRC channel on Freenode.

## Bugs

We use GitHub issues to keep track of our project, broadly, including bugs and enhancements with the code or its documentation. If you're familiar with that process, great! We look forward to your report. Otherwise, **point to a good intro to GitHub**.

## Coding

We don't have a preference, in this regard. If you know how to use GitHub, and have contributed to open source projects before, then:

* Submit a pull request
* File an issue + Submit a pull request
* Use this project somewhere :)

And be sure to add yourself to the [AUTHORS](/AUTHORS)
file as part of your PR(s). Every contribution counts, no matter how big or small!

## Documentation

As above, PRs related to docu are very much appreciated. We want our project to be as friendly and approachable as possible, which starts with the words around it! Even if your idea is around a gap in our [CODE OF CONDUCT](/CODE_OF_CONDUCT), please don't be shy; just dive in and show us what you've got. :-)

## Pre-built binaries

We've decided to put our efforts elsewhere to date, but if you have a passion for a certain operating system, or see this as an important step to spreading the word, we'll happily support your efforts. File an issue, and let's discuss how we can make it even easier to get a pod up and running!

## Running a pod

Check out **INSTALL.md** for details on building and running a pod. It's designed to be painless, we promise! Or, if that isn't your bag, we could run one for you: checking our **new landing page** for details.

## Show us some love!

Finally, every little bit does help, honestly. Whether it's buying our hard-working devs a coffee, plugging our project in that obscure corner of the 'net that attracts new help, or just giving us a virtual pat on the back, it's all good. :-D

Thanks for using twtxt!
